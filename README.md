# Handwritten Digit Recognition
Overview: 

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying these digits based on the pixel data from the images.

Features :

Data Preprocessing: Normalize and preprocess the dataset for optimal training.
Model Training: Utilize various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) to train the model.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
User Interface: A simple interface to input handwritten digits and receive predictions.
